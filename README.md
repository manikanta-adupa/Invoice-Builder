Invoice Builder Exercise

I created a simple Invoice builder which take input service and quantiy and return the item in a cart section. I used  local storage to keep the state and used clear cart functionality to remove from local storage. I have used in-built functions to calculate total. The whole thing could be more organized through components but did what I can do as i had less time.
