Invoice Builder Exercise

I created a simple Invoice builder which take input service and quantiy and return the item in a cart section. I used  local storage to keep the state and used clear cart functionality to remove from local storage. I have used in-built functions to calculate total. The whole thing could be more organized through components but did what I can do as i had less time. I also could not add unit tests, as I had less time.

To look at live demo:

Clone the repo in your cli:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/invoice-builder.git

Navigate to directory
cd invoice-builder

Install dependencies
npm install

Start server:
npm start

Navigate to the below url:
